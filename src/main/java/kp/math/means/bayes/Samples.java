Examples 0, 1, 2, 3:
The combination of 1% FN and 1% FP.
.......................................................................................................
Example 4:
Approximately 1% of patients have disease (99'000 patients 'Negative Genuine' vs 1'000 patients 'Positive Genuine')
(i.e. disease’s prevalence is 1%)
- patient with disease    (Pos.Gen.) has a 90% chance of a true  positive test result -> 10% false negative -> modeled as   900 TP vs    100 FN 
- patient without disease (Neg.Gen.) has a 10% chance of a false positive test result -> 90% true  negative -> modeled as 9'900 FP vs 89'100 TN 
What is the probability a patient has disease given that he just had a positive test? The answer was 8.3%.
.......................................................................................................
Example 5:
Drug test is 99% sensitive(TPR) and 99% specific (TNR)
0.5% of people are users of the drug -> modeled as 99'500 vs 500  
- the    500     users has a 99% chance of a true  positive test result ->  1% false negative -> modeled as 495 TP vs      5 FN
- the 99'500 non-users has a  1% chance of a false positive test result -> 99% true  negative -> modeled as 995 FP vs 98'505 TN 
  (0.01 × 99 500 = 995 false positives)
What is the probability that he is a user? The answer was 33.2%.
.......................................................................................................
Example 6:
Approximately 1% of patients have disease (99'000 patients 'Negative Genuine' vs 1'000 patients 'Positive Genuine')
Patient is  X years old  0.2% ->    200 people 
Patient not X years old 99.8% -> 99'800 people
Probability of a person diagnosed with disease being X years old is 0.5% -> of the 1'000 people with disease, only 5 people will be X years old. 
-     have disease and is  X years old ->      5 people true  positive
-     have disease and not X years old ->    995 people false negative
                                                                       -> modeled as   5 TP vs    995 FN
- not have disease and is  X years old ->    195 people false positive
- not have disease and not X years old -> 98'805 people true  negative
                                                                       -> modeled as 195 FP vs 98'805 TN
What is the probability a patient at age X has a disease? The answer was ~2.5%.
.......................................................................................................
Example 7: (from "Confusion of the Inverse")
Give the chances of disease with a 1% prior probability of occurring. (99'000 patients 'Negative Genuine' vs 1'000 patients 'Positive Genuine')
A test can detect 80% of diseases and has a 10% false positive rate.
- patient with disease    (Pos.Gen.) has an 80% chance of a true  positive test result -> 20% false negative -> modeled as   800 TP vs    200 FN
- patient without disease (Neg.Gen.) has a 10% chance of a false positive test result -> 90% true  negative -> modeled as 9'900 FP vs 89'100 TN 
What is the probability of disease given a positive test result? The answer was ~7.5% 
.......................................................................................................
Example 8: (from "Confusion of the Inverse")
Suppose 1% of the group suffer from the disease, and the rest are well. -> modeled as 99'000 vs 1'000
Screening test is 99% sensitive(TPR) and 99% specific (TNR)
- the  1'000 sick    persons has a 99% chance of a true  positive test result ->  1% false negative -> modeled as 999 TP vs      1 FN
- the 99'000 healthy persons has a  1% chance of a false positive test result -> 99% true  negative -> modeled as 990 FP vs 98'010 TN 
What is the probability that an individual actually has the disease? The answer was ~50%.
.......................................................................................................
Example 9: (to observe False Positive Paradox)
Changing rate of patients with the disease from 1% (from item 8. above) to 10% -> modeled as 90'000 vs 10'000
 1% false negative -> modeled as 9'990 TP vs     10 FN
99% true  negative -> modeled as   900 FP vs 99'100 TN
The answer goes up from ~50% to ~92%.
For  1% :  1'000 people are actually infected and  1'989 people have a positive test result.
For 10% : 10'000 people are actually infected and 10'890 people have a positive test result.
.......................................................................................................
Examples 10 and 11: (comparing two cases)
- genuine  negative 50 & positive 50
- received negative 50 & positive 50
